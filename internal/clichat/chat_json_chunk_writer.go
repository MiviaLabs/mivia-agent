// The deltas arrive as arbitrary byte slices with no guarantee that a
// multi-byte UTF-8 rune is not split across two consecutive Write calls.
// Marshaling each raw Write independently would let json.Marshal silently
// replace a split rune's dangling bytes with U+FFFD on each side, corrupting
// otherwise-valid text. This writer buffers any incomplete trailing UTF-8
// sequence across calls and only emits a chunk once the buffered bytes are
// confirmed to end on a complete rune boundary.
