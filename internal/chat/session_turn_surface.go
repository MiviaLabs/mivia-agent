// wireStepBoundaryAdmission installs the mid-turn admission publication hook
// and the staged-tool denial message on the turn's options. A tool staged by
// load_tools becomes callable from the NEXT STEP: the loop's Surface hook
// publishes it at the next step boundary, mid-turn, before this turn's commit
// (w2a/w2d). When that boundary defers (R2-1/R2-2), a call to the staged tool
// must report pending publication and the reason instead of the unknown-tool
// denial; the check is dynamic so a same-turn stage is visible too, and it
// announces the deferral cause mid-turn. Scoped turns (TurnOptions/skills) run
// their own surface and must not publish into the session surface mid-turn, so
// the publication is gated on turn == nil.
